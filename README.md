when an item is selected its proceeds to another scene where you input the quantity and payment amount and click on done and get receipts. 
The Receipts are stored in a folder named “Receipts”; 
The program ensues that no file has the same name by using a time format to name the receipts it prints the time down to the millisecond to add to the file name. 
Each scene has a back button to go back to the previous scene in case of a mistake.
